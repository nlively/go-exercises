Hereâ€™s a set of assignments designed to help you practice and deepen your understanding of algorithms and data structures in Go. Each assignment builds on the concepts discussed earlier and introduces new challenges.

### Assignment 1: Sorting Algorithms
1. **Implement Selection Sort**:
   - Write a Go program that implements the Selection Sort algorithm. 
   - Compare its performance with Bubble Sort by timing both sorts on a large array.

2. **Implement Insertion Sort**:
   - Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm in Go.
   - Modify the algorithm to work with a slice of strings instead of integers.

### Assignment 2: Search Algorithms
1. **Binary Search Variations**:
   - Implement a recursive version of the Binary Search algorithm.
   - Modify Binary Search to work with a list of floating-point numbers.

2. **Linear Search**:
   - Write a simple Linear Search function and compare its performance with Binary Search.
   - Use Linear Search to find the minimum and maximum values in an unsorted array.

### Assignment 3: Linked Lists
1. **Doubly Linked List**:
   - Implement a Doubly Linked List where each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes.
   - Add methods for inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes.

2. **Circular Linked List**:
   - Modify the Singly Linked List to create a Circular Linked List where the last node points to the first node.
   - Implement a method to detect if a linked list is circular.

### Assignment 4: Recursion and Dynamic Programming
1. **Fibonacci Sequence**:
   - Implement a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
   - Implement the same function using dynamic programming (memoization) to improve efficiency.

2. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   - Implement an iterative version of the factorial function and compare its performance with the recursive version.

### Assignment 5: Advanced Data Structures
1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - Implement a Binary Search Tree with insertion, deletion, and search operations.
   - Write a function to find the height of the BST.
   - Implement an in-order traversal of the tree and print the sorted elements.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Implement a graph using an adjacency list.
   - Write functions to add vertices, add edges, and print the graph.
   - Implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph.

### Assignment 6: Algorithms Practice
1. **Merge Sort**:
   - Implement the Merge Sort algorithm.
   - Write tests to verify its correctness with different types of data.

2. **Quick Sort**:
   - Implement the Quick Sort algorithm.
   - Analyze its performance and compare it with Merge Sort.

### Assignment 7: Miscellaneous Algorithms
1. **Palindrome Checker**:
   - Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
   - Extend the function to ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

2. **Anagram Checker**:
   - Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
   - Consider different cases and special characters in your implementation.

### Assignment 8: Working with Files and Data
1. **Word Frequency Counter**:
   - Write a Go program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word.
   - Print the top 10 most frequent words along with their counts.

2. **CSV File Processing**:
   - Write a program that reads a CSV file, sorts the data by a specific column, and writes the sorted data back to a new CSV file.
   - Handle edge cases, such as missing or malformed data.

### Assignment 9: Concurrency in Go
1. **Concurrent Sorting**:
   - Implement a concurrent version of the Merge Sort algorithm using Go routines and channels.
   - Measure the performance improvement over the sequential version.

2. **Producer-Consumer Problem**:
   - Implement a producer-consumer problem using Go routines and channels.
   - Ensure thread safety and avoid deadlocks.

### Assignment 10: Real-World Problem
1. **Web Scraper**:
   - Write a simple web scraper in Go that extracts specific information from a webpage (e.g., headlines from a news site).
   - Implement concurrency to scrape multiple pages in parallel.
   - Handle errors and edge cases like missing elements or network issues.

2. **RESTful API**:
   - Create a simple RESTful API in Go to manage a collection of resources (e.g., a list of tasks).
   - Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Secure the API with basic authentication or token-based authentication.

### Suggested Workflow

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the fundamental assignments, especially if you're new to a concept.
2. **Test Continuously**: Write tests for your functions to ensure correctness.
3. **Analyze and Compare**: Where applicable, compare the performance of different algorithms and implementations.
4. **Ask for Feedback**: If possible, get your code reviewed by peers or mentors.
5. **Iterate**: Improve your code based on feedback and your own observations.
