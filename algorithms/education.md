Great! Let's start with some fundamental algorithms that are useful in various programming scenarios. We'll cover three types of algorithms:

1. **Sorting Algorithm**: Bubble Sort
2. **Searching Algorithm**: Binary Search
3. **Data Structures**: Linked List Implementation

We’ll implement these in Go, focusing on clarity and good coding practices. I'll also include error handling where relevant.

### 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's how you can implement Bubble Sort in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func bubbleSort(arr []int) {
	n := len(arr)
	for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
		swapped := false
		for j := 0; j < n-i-1; j++ {
			if arr[j] > arr[j+1] {
				arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
				swapped = true
			}
		}
		// If no elements were swapped, the array is already sorted
		if !swapped {
			break
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	arr := []int{64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}
	fmt.Println("Original array:", arr)

	bubbleSort(arr)
	fmt.Println("Sorted array:", arr)
}
```

### 2. Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the interval is narrowed to the lower half. Otherwise, it is narrowed to the upper half.

Here's how you can implement Binary Search in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"errors"
)

func binarySearch(arr []int, target int) (int, error) {
	low, high := 0, len(arr)-1
	
	for low <= high {
		mid := low + (high-low)/2

		if arr[mid] == target {
			return mid, nil
		} else if arr[mid] < target {
			low = mid + 1
		} else {
			high = mid - 1
		}
	}
	return -1, errors.New("element not found")
}

func main() {
	arr := []int{2, 3, 4, 10, 40}
	target := 10
	
	result, err := binarySearch(arr, target)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Element found at index %d\n", result)
	}
}
```

### 3. Linked List Implementation

A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, often called nodes. Each node contains a data field and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list.

Here's a simple implementation of a singly linked list in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"errors"
)

type Node struct {
	data int
	next *Node
}

type LinkedList struct {
	head *Node
}

func (ll *LinkedList) Insert(value int) {
	newNode := &Node{data: value}
	if ll.head == nil {
		ll.head = newNode
	} else {
		current := ll.head
		for current.next != nil {
			current = current.next
		}
		current.next = newNode
	}
}

func (ll *LinkedList) Display() {
	if ll.head == nil {
		fmt.Println("Linked list is empty")
		return
	}

	current := ll.head
	for current != nil {
		fmt.Printf("%d -> ", current.data)
		current = current.next
	}
	fmt.Println("nil")
}

func (ll *LinkedList) Search(value int) (*Node, error) {
	current := ll.head
	for current != nil {
		if current.data == value {
			return current, nil
		}
		current = current.next
	}
	return nil, errors.New("element not found in linked list")
}

func main() {
	ll := &LinkedList{}
	ll.Insert(10)
	ll.Insert(20)
	ll.Insert(30)
	
	fmt.Println("Linked List:")
	ll.Display()

	if node, err := ll.Search(20); err == nil {
		fmt.Printf("Element %d found in linked list\n", node.data)
	} else {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```

### Explanation and Next Steps

- **Bubble Sort**: It's a simple and intuitive way to sort a list, but it’s not the most efficient (O(n^2) in worst case).
- **Binary Search**: Very efficient (O(log n)), but requires the array to be sorted beforehand.
- **Linked List**: Useful when you need a data structure that can easily grow and shrink in size without needing to reorganize other elements.

### Practice

Try modifying these algorithms:
- Enhance Bubble Sort to work with different types (e.g., strings).
- Implement a recursive version of Binary Search.
- Add a method to delete a node from the linked list.
