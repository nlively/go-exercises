Here are some exercises in Go that focus on concurrency. These exercises are designed to help you develop a deep understanding of goroutines, channels, and other concurrency patterns.

### 1. **Basic Goroutines and Channels**
   - **Task:** Write a program that starts two goroutines. The first goroutine should generate a sequence of numbers (e.g., 1 to 10) and send them to a channel. The second goroutine should receive these numbers from the channel, square them, and print the result.
   - **Goal:** Get comfortable with basic goroutines and channel communication.

### 2. **Fan-In Pattern**
   - **Task:** Implement a "fan-in" function that takes multiple channels as input and multiplexes the messages onto a single channel. Use this function to merge the outputs of two different goroutines generating sequences of numbers.
   - **Goal:** Learn how to aggregate results from multiple concurrent tasks.

### 3. **Worker Pool**
   - **Task:** Create a worker pool where a fixed number of goroutines (workers) process tasks from a shared task queue. Each worker should process tasks concurrently, and the main goroutine should wait for all workers to finish before exiting.
   - **Goal:** Understand how to manage a pool of workers to efficiently process tasks concurrently.

### 4. **Pipeline Pattern**
   - **Task:** Create a pipeline where data flows through multiple stages, each stage represented by a goroutine. For example, the first stage reads data from a channel, the second stage processes it, and the third stage outputs the final result.
   - **Goal:** Practice structuring programs with multiple stages of processing in a pipeline.

### 5. **Rate Limiter**
   - **Task:** Implement a rate limiter using channels. The rate limiter should allow only a certain number of operations per second. You can test this by creating a goroutine that tries to perform an operation at a higher rate and observe how the rate limiter handles it.
   - **Goal:** Learn how to control the rate of operations in a concurrent program.

### 6. **Dining Philosophers Problem**
   - **Task:** Solve the dining philosophers problem using goroutines and channels. Ensure that your solution avoids deadlock and ensures that each philosopher eventually gets to eat.
   - **Goal:** Gain experience in dealing with synchronization issues and avoiding deadlocks.

### 7. **Concurrent Web Crawler**
   - **Task:** Write a concurrent web crawler that takes a list of URLs and crawls them concurrently. Use a channel to limit the number of concurrent requests. Also, ensure that each URL is only crawled once.
   - **Goal:** Practice handling concurrency in a real-world scenario, dealing with synchronization and limiting resources.

### 8. **Concurrent Prime Number Finder**
   - **Task:** Write a program that finds prime numbers within a given range using multiple goroutines. Each goroutine should handle a portion of the range. Aggregate the results and print the primes.
   - **Goal:** Understand how to split work across multiple goroutines and aggregate the results.

### 9. **Timeouts with Select**
   - **Task:** Write a program that simulates a network request by sleeping for a random duration. Implement a timeout mechanism using Go’s `select` statement to ensure that if the request takes too long, it’s canceled and a timeout error is returned.
   - **Goal:** Learn to use `select` for handling timeouts and channel operations.

### 10. **Concurrent Fibonacci Calculator**
   - **Task:** Implement a program that calculates Fibonacci numbers concurrently. Each Fibonacci number should be calculated by a separate goroutine, and the results should be collected and printed in order.
   - **Goal:** Practice managing the order of results in a concurrent environment.

### 11. **Concurrent File Processing**
   - **Task:** Write a program that processes multiple files concurrently. Each file should be processed in its own goroutine, and the results should be written to a separate output file.
   - **Goal:** Get experience in handling file I/O concurrently, ensuring that results are processed correctly and in parallel.

### 12. **Cancellation with Context**
   - **Task:** Implement a long-running computation or operation and allow it to be canceled by using Go’s `context` package. Pass a `context.Context` to the goroutines and ensure they respect cancellation.
   - **Goal:** Learn to use Go's `context` package for managing cancellations in concurrent programs.

These exercises will help you get more comfortable with concurrency in Go. Make sure to handle errors properly and ensure that resources like goroutines and channels are cleaned up correctly.
