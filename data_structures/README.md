Hereâ€™s a list of exercises in Go to help you learn data structures such as binary trees and linked lists:

### Linked Lists
1. **Implement a Singly Linked List:**
   - Create a `Node` struct with an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
   - Implement functions to insert at the beginning, end, and middle of the list.
   - Implement a function to delete a node given its value.
   - Implement a function to reverse the linked list.

2. **Detect a Cycle in a Linked List:**
   - Write a function that checks if there is a cycle in a linked list (using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm).

3. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists:**
   - Implement a function to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

4. **Remove Duplicates from a Linked List:**
   - Implement a function to remove duplicate values from a sorted linked list.

5. **Find the nth Node from the End:**
   - Write a function that returns the nth node from the end of a linked list.

### Binary Trees
1. **Implement a Binary Tree:**
   - Create a `Node` struct with an integer value and pointers to left and right children.
   - Implement functions for inserting a node, searching for a value, and deleting a node in the binary tree.

2. **Binary Tree Traversal:**
   - Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal methods.
   - Implement a level-order traversal (breadth-first search).

3. **Find the Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree:**
   - Write a function that returns the maximum depth of a binary tree.

4. **Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced:**
   - Implement a function that checks whether a binary tree is height-balanced.

5. **Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree:**
   - Write a function to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

6. **Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree (BST):**
   - Given a sorted array, implement a function to create a balanced BST.

### Advanced
1. **Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree:**
   - Implement functions to serialize a binary tree to a string and deserialize it back to a binary tree.

2. **Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal:**
   - Implement a function that returns the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level, and so on).

3. **Flatten a Binary Tree to Linked List:**
   - Write a function to flatten a binary tree to a linked list in-place.

4. **Implement a Doubly Linked List:**
   - Extend the singly linked list by adding a previous pointer and implement similar operations.

### Bonus
1. **Expression Tree:**
   - Create an expression tree that can evaluate arithmetic expressions given in postfix notation.

2. **Binary Tree Paths:**
   - Implement a function that returns all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.

3. **Linked List Intersection:**
   - Write a function that detects the intersection point of two linked lists.

These exercises should provide a solid understanding of linked lists and binary trees in Go.
