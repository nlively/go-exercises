# Module 8: Neural Networks Basics

## Lesson 1: What is a Neural Network? Understanding Neurons and Layers

### Content:
- **What is a Neural Network?**
  - A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
  - **Neurons:** Each neuron receives inputs, processes them (usually through a weighted sum and activation function), and passes the output to the next layer.

- **Layers in a Neural Network:**
  - **Input Layer:** Receives the raw data.
  - **Hidden Layers:** Perform computations and transformations on the data. The number of hidden layers and neurons determines the network's complexity.
  - **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction or classification.

- **Activation Functions:**
  - Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to capture complex patterns.
  - **Common Activation Functions:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, Tanh.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Neural Networks are the foundation of many modern AI applications, including image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.

## Lesson 2: Feedforward Neural Networks - Forward Propagation

### Content:
- **Feedforward Neural Networks:**
  - In a Feedforward Neural Network, the data flows from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer without looping back.

- **Forward Propagation:**
  - The process of computing the output of a neural network given an input.
  - **Steps:**
    - Calculate the weighted sum of inputs for each neuron.
    - Apply the activation function to the weighted sum.
    - Pass the result to the next layer.

- **Output Calculation:**
  - The final layer's output represents the model's prediction. For classification tasks, this output is often passed through a softmax function to produce probabilities.

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement forward propagation for a simple feedforward neural network in Go.

## Lesson 3: Backpropagation - The Key to Training Neural Networks

### Content:
- **What is Backpropagation?**
  - Backpropagation is the process of adjusting the weights in a neural network based on the error of the output. It is a key component of training neural networks.

- **Steps in Backpropagation:**
  - **Calculate the Error:** Compute the difference between the predicted output and the actual target.
  - **Propagate the Error Backwards:** Distribute the error back through the network by calculating the gradient of the error with respect to each weight.
  - **Update the Weights:** Adjust the weights using the calculated gradients, typically with an optimization algorithm like Gradient Descent.

- **Why Backpropagation is Important:**
  - It allows the neural network to learn from data and improve its predictions over time.

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement backpropagation for the feedforward neural network you built in the previous lesson.
