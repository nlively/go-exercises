# Module 7: Introduction to Classification

## Lesson 1: What is Classification? Understanding Labels and Features

### Content:
- **What is Classification?**
  - Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to assign a label to an input based on its features.
  - **Example:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on their content.

- **Features and Labels:**
  - **Features:** The attributes or properties of the input data used to make predictions.
  - **Labels:** The categories or classes that the model assigns to the input data.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Classification is widely used in tasks such as image recognition, spam detection, and medical diagnosis.

## Lesson 2: Introduction to Decision Trees - A Simple Yet Powerful Classifier

### Content:
- **What is a Decision Tree?**
  - A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like model where each internal node represents a "decision" based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents a class label.
  - **How it works:** The tree splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is repeated recursively until the data is classified.

- **Building a Decision Tree:**
  - **Splitting Criteria:** Use metrics like Gini Impurity or Information Gain to decide the best feature to split the data at each node.
  - **Pruning:** Reducing the size of the tree by removing nodes that provide little to no additional value, preventing overfitting.

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement a basic decision tree classifier in Go and train it on a small dataset.

## Lesson 3: Evaluating Classifiers - Accuracy, Precision, Recall

### Content:
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
  - **Formula:** 
    \[
    	ext{Accuracy} = rac{	ext{True Positives} + 	ext{True Negatives}}{	ext{Total Instances}}
    \]

- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive results out of all positive predictions.
  - **Formula:** 
    \[
    	ext{Precision} = rac{	ext{True Positives}}{	ext{True Positives} + 	ext{False Positives}}
    \]

- **Recall:** The proportion of true positive results out of all actual positives.
  - **Formula:** 
    \[
    	ext{Recall} = rac{	ext{True Positives}}{	ext{True Positives} + 	ext{False Negatives}}
    \]

- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances the two.
  - **Formula:** 
    \[
    F1 = 2 	imes rac{	ext{Precision} 	imes 	ext{Recall}}{	ext{Precision} + 	ext{Recall}}
    \]

### Practical Exercise:
- Evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifier you implemented in the previous lesson using these metrics.
