# Module 9: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## Lesson 1: What is Reinforcement Learning? Key Concepts (Agents, Rewards, Policies)

### Content:
- **What is Reinforcement Learning?**
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

- **Key Concepts in RL:**
  - **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker.
  - **Environment:** The setting with which the agent interacts.
  - **Actions:** The choices available to the agent.
  - **State:** A representation of the current situation of the environment.
  - **Reward:** The feedback from the environment based on the agent's action.
  - **Policy:** The strategy that the agent uses to decide its actions.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Reinforcement learning is used in various domains such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

## Lesson 2: The Q-Learning Algorithm - Learning Optimal Actions

### Content:
- **What is Q-Learning?**
  - Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to learn the value of an action in a particular state, enabling the agent to maximize its rewards over time.
  - **Q-Function:**
    \[
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + lpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) ight]
    \]
    Where:
    - \(s\) is the current state.
    - \(a\) is the action taken.
    - \(r\) is the reward received after taking action \(a\).
    - \(s'\) is the next state.
    - \(lpha\) is the learning rate.
    - \(\gamma\) is the discount factor for future rewards.

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
  - The agent must balance exploring new actions to discover their effects (exploration) with choosing actions that are known to yield high rewards (exploitation).

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement the Q-Learning algorithm in Go to solve a simple grid-world problem.

## Lesson 3: Exploration vs. Exploitation - The Balance in Reinforcement Learning

### Content:
- **Exploration Strategies:**
  - **Epsilon-Greedy:** With probability \( \epsilon \), choose a random action (exploration), and with probability \( 1 - \epsilon \), choose the action that maximizes the Q-value (exploitation).
  - **Decay Rate:** Decrease \( \epsilon \) over time to shift from exploration to exploitation as the agent learns more about the environment.

- **Trade-offs:**
  - **Too Much Exploration:** The agent may spend too much time trying suboptimal actions, leading to slower learning.
  - **Too Much Exploitation:** The agent may miss out on discovering better actions that could lead to higher long-term rewards.

### Practical Exercise:
- Experiment with different exploration strategies in the Q-Learning algorithm and observe their impact on the agent's performance.
