## Lesson 1: What is Optimization? An Introduction to Cost Functions

### Content:
- **What is Optimization?**
  - Optimization involves adjusting the parameters of a model to minimize or maximize a cost function, which measures how well the model performs.
  - **Example:** Minimizing the error in a regression model to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Cost Function:**
  - A cost function (also known as a loss function) measures the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual output.
  - **Example:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common cost function used in regression tasks.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Understanding cost functions is essential for guiding the training process of machine learning models.

## Lesson 2: Gradient Descent - The Workhorse of Optimization

### Content:
- **What is Gradient Descent?**
  - Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by adjusting the model's parameters.
  - **Key Concept:**
    - The gradient (or slope) of the cost function indicates the direction and rate of the steepest ascent. Gradient descent moves in the opposite direction (downhill) to minimize the cost.

- **Types of Gradient Descent:**
  - **Batch Gradient Descent:** Computes the gradient using the entire dataset.
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Computes the gradient using a single training example.
  - **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** Computes the gradient using a small batch of training examples.

- **Learning Rate:**
  - The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken during optimization. A high learning rate can lead to overshooting the minimum, while a low rate can result in slow convergence.

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement Gradient Descent in Go to optimize a simple linear regression model.

## Lesson 3: Implementing Gradient Descent in Go

### Content:
- **Steps to Implement Gradient Descent:**
  - Initialize model parameters (e.g., weights and biases) randomly.
  - Compute the cost function using the current parameters.
  - Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
  - Update the parameters by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient from each parameter.
  - Repeat the process until the cost function converges (i.e., further iterations don't significantly reduce the cost).

### Practical Exercise:
- Write a Go program that implements Gradient Descent for a linear regression model.
- Train the model on a small dataset and evaluate its performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
