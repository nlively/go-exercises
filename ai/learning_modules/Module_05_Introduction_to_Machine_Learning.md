# Module 5: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Lesson 1: What is Machine Learning? Key Concepts and Terminology

### Content:
- **What is Machine Learning?**
  - Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.
  - **Example:** Training a model to recognize images of cats and dogs by showing it thousands of labeled images.

- **Key Concepts in ML:**
  - **Model:** A mathematical representation of a process that can make predictions or decisions based on input data.
  - **Training:** The process of teaching a model by feeding it data and adjusting parameters to minimize errors.
  - **Testing:** The process of evaluating a model's performance on unseen data.
  - **Overfitting:** When a model learns too much from the training data, including noise, leading to poor performance on new data.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Understanding these concepts is crucial for building, training, and evaluating ML models.

## Lesson 2: Types of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)

### Content:
- **Supervised Learning:**
  - In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, where each input is paired with a known output.
  - **Example:** Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and age.

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - In unsupervised learning, the model is given data without explicit labels and must find patterns or groupings on its own.
  - **Example:** Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.

- **Reinforcement Learning:**
  - In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.
  - **Example:** Training a robot to navigate a maze by rewarding it for reaching the goal.

- **Comparison and Use Cases:**
  - **Supervised Learning:** Used when historical data with clear outcomes is available.
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Used for exploring data to find hidden patterns.
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Ideal for tasks involving sequential decision-making, such as robotics or gaming.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Each type of learning has specific use cases and requires different approaches to model building and evaluation.

## Lesson 3: Introduction to Linear Regression - The Simplest ML Algorithm

### Content:
- **What is Linear Regression?**
  - Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    y = mx + c
    \]
    Where:
    - \(y\) is the dependent variable.
    - \(m\) is the slope of the line (coefficient).
    - \(x\) is the independent variable.
    - \(c\) is the y-intercept (constant).

- **How Linear Regression Works:**
  - The algorithm finds the best-fitting straight line through the data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

- **Practical Exercise:**
  - Implement a simple linear regression model in Go to predict a value based on a small dataset, such as predicting housing prices based on square footage.
