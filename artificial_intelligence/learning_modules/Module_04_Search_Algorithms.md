# Module 4: Introduction to Search Algorithms

## Lesson 1: Search in AI - Introduction to Search Spaces

### Content:
- **What is a Search Space?**
  - A search space is a defined area or collection of possible solutions that an algorithm explores to find an optimal or satisfactory solution.
  - In AI, search problems often involve finding a sequence of actions that lead to a desired goal state from an initial state.

- **State Space Representation:**
  - States represent configurations or positions in the search space. A problem can be abstracted into states and transitions between them.
  - **Example:** In a maze, each position in the maze can be considered a state, and moving in any direction changes the state.

- **Search Tree:**
  - A search tree is a tree structure used to represent the sequence of actions that lead from the initial state to the goal state. Nodes represent states, and edges represent actions.
  - **Root Node:** The initial state.
  - **Leaf Nodes:** Possible outcomes (goal or failure).

- **Search Algorithms:**
  - Search algorithms explore the search space by systematically selecting which paths to follow.

### Practical Application in AI:
- Understanding search spaces is fundamental in AI for tasks like problem-solving, pathfinding, and game-playing.

## Lesson 2: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Content:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
  - DFS is a search algorithm that explores as far down a branch of the search tree as possible before backtracking.
  - **Key Characteristics:**
    - Explores deep paths before shallow ones.
    - Uses a stack (explicitly or implicitly via recursion).
    - Can get stuck in deep, infinite paths (if not careful).

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
  - BFS is a search algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
  - **Key Characteristics:**
    - Explores all options at the current level before moving deeper.
    - Uses a queue to keep track of nodes to explore.
    - Guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

- **Comparison:**
  - **DFS:** May be more memory-efficient but can be slower in finding a solution.
  - **BFS:** More exhaustive but can consume more memory.

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement both DFS and BFS in Go to solve a simple graph traversal problem, such as finding a path through a maze.

## Lesson 3: Introduction to Heuristics and the A* Algorithm

### Content:
- **Heuristics in AI:**
  - A heuristic is a rule of thumb or an approximation that helps to simplify the search process.
  - Heuristics guide the search algorithm to prioritize paths that are more likely to lead to the goal.

- **The A* Algorithm:**
  - A* is a popular search algorithm that uses both the cost to reach a node and a heuristic to estimate the cost from that node to the goal.
  - **Formula:** 
    \[
    f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
    \]
    Where:
    - \(g(n)\) is the cost to reach the node \(n\) from the start.
    - \(h(n)\) is the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from \(n\).
    - \(f(n)\) is the estimated total cost of the cheapest path through \(n\).

- **Properties of A*:**
  - **Complete:** A* will find a solution if one exists.
  - **Optimal:** A* will find the optimal solution if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal).

### Practical Exercise:
- Implement the A* algorithm in Go to solve a pathfinding problem, such as navigating a grid-based maze.
