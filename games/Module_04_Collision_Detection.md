### **Module 4: Collision Detection and Physics**

#### **1. Introduction to Collision Detection**

**Basics of Collision Detection:**
- **What is Collision Detection?**
  - Collision detection involves determining when two or more objects in a game intersect or touch each other.

- **Why is Collision Detection Important?**
  - It's essential for implementing interactions such as character movement, object interactions, and gameplay mechanics.

**Types of Collisions:**
- **Bounding Box Collision:**
  - Uses rectangular boundaries around objects to detect collisions.
  - Simple and effective for many 2D games.

- **Pixel-Perfect Collision:**
  - More precise but computationally expensive.
  - Checks if actual pixels overlap between objects.

#### **2. Implementing Bounding Box Collision**

**Bounding Box Basics:**
- **What is a Bounding Box?**
  - A rectangle that surrounds an object for the purpose of collision detection.

- **Checking for Overlap:**
  - To determine if two bounding boxes overlap, compare their positions and dimensions.

**Collision Detection Code:**
- **Bounding Box Collision Function:**
  Implement a function to check if two rectangles overlap.

  ```go
  func RectsIntersect(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2 float64) bool {
      return x1 < x2+w2 && x1+w1 > x2 && y1 < y2+h2 && y1+h1 > y2
  }
  ```

- **Example Usage:**
  - Use this function to detect collisions between the player and other objects.

  ```go
  func (g *Game) Update() error {
      if RectsIntersect(g.playerX, g.playerY, 20, 20, g.objectX, g.objectY, 20, 20) {
          // Handle collision
      }
      return nil
  }
  ```

#### **3. Implementing Basic Physics**

**Understanding Basic Physics:**
- **What is Basic Physics in Games?**
  - Basic physics includes concepts like movement, gravity, and acceleration to make the game feel realistic.

- **Common Physics Concepts:**
  - **Gravity:** Simulates the effect of gravity on objects.
  - **Velocity and Acceleration:** Controls how objects move and change speed.

**Basic Physics Implementation:**
- **Applying Gravity:**
  - Update the vertical velocity of an object based on gravity.

  ```go
  func (g *Game) Update() error {
      g.playerY += g.velocityY
      g.velocityY += 0.1 // Gravity effect
      return nil
  }
  ```

- **Handling Movement:**
  - Update object positions based on velocity.

  ```go
  func (g *Game) Update() error {
      g.playerX += g.velocityX
      g.playerY += g.velocityY
      return nil
  }
  ```

#### **4. Exercise: Implementing Collision Detection and Basic Physics**

**Objective:**
Create a simple game where objects can move, and collisions are detected between the player and other objects.

**Steps:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Install Ebiten if you havenâ€™t already.
   - Create a new Go file for your project.

2. **Implement Bounding Box Collision:**
   - Add the `RectsIntersect` function to your game code.
   - Use it to detect collisions between the player and other objects.

3. **Implement Basic Physics:**
   - Add gravity to your game.
   - Implement velocity and update positions based on physics.

4. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test collisions and physics behavior.
   - Adjust parameters to achieve desired gameplay mechanics.

**Sample Code:**

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"
    "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/ebitenutil"
    "image/color"
    "log"
)

type Game struct {
    playerX, playerY, objectX, objectY float64
    velocityX, velocityY               float64
}

func RectsIntersect(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2 float64) bool {
    return x1 < x2+w2 && x1+w1 > x2 && y1 < y2+h2 && y1+h1 > y2
}

func (g *Game) Update() error {
    // Apply gravity
    g.velocityY += 0.1
    g.playerY += g.velocityY
    g.playerX += g.velocityX
    
    // Detect collision
    if RectsIntersect(g.playerX, g.playerY, 20, 20, g.objectX, g.objectY, 20, 20) {
        log.Println("Collision detected!")
    }
    
    return nil
}

func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
    screen.Fill(color.RGBA{0, 0, 255, 255}) // Fill background with blue
    ebitenutil.DrawRect(screen, g.playerX, g.playerY, 20, 20, color.RGBA{255, 0, 0, 255}) // Draw player
    ebitenutil.DrawRect(screen, g.objectX, g.objectY, 20, 20, color.RGBA{0, 255, 0, 255}) // Draw object
}

func (g *Game) Layout(outsideWidth, outsideHeight int) (int, int) {
    return 640, 480
}

func main() {
    game := &Game{}
    ebiten.SetWindowSize(640, 480)
    ebiten.SetWindowTitle("Collision Detection and Physics")
    if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```
