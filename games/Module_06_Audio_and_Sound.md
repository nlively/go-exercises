#### **2. Assignment 1: Adding Background Music**

**Objective:** Integrate background music into your game to set the tone and atmosphere.

**Concepts:**

1. **Loading Music:** Load and play a background music file.
2. **Music Looping:** Ensure the music loops smoothly during gameplay.

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Music File:**
   - Obtain or create a background music file in a supported format (e.g., WAV, OGG).

2. **Code Example:**

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"
       "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/audio"
       "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/audio/context"
       "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/audio/ogg"
       "os"
   )

   const (
       StateMenu = iota
       StateGameplay
       StateGameOver
   )

   type GameState struct {
       CurrentState int
   }

   type Game struct {
       state        GameState
       musicContext *audio.Context
       musicPlayer  *audio.Player
   }

   func (g *Game) Update() error {
       // Update logic (same as previous examples)
       return nil
   }

   func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
       switch g.state.CurrentState {
       case StateMenu:
           // Draw menu (same as previous examples)
       case StateGameplay:
           // Draw gameplay (same as previous examples)
       case StateGameOver:
           // Draw game over (same as previous examples)
       }
   }

   func (g *Game) Layout(outsideWidth, outsideHeight int) (int, int) {
       return 640, 480
   }

   func loadMusic(filePath string) (*audio.Player, error) {
       ctx := audio.NewContext(44100)
       f, err := os.Open(filePath)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }
       defer f.Close()

       d, err := ogg.DecodeWith(ctx, f)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       p, err := ctx.NewPlayer(d)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       return p, nil
   }

   func main() {
       game := &Game{
           state: GameState{CurrentState: StateMenu},
       }

       var err error
       game.musicPlayer, err = loadMusic("background_music.ogg")
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }

       game.musicPlayer.Play()

       if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - **`loadMusic`** function loads an OGG music file and creates an audio player.

       d, err := ogg.DecodeWith(ctx, f)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       p, err := ctx.NewPlayer(d)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       return p, nil
   }

   func main() {
       game := &Game{
           state: GameState{CurrentState: StateMenu},
       }

       var err error
       game.jumpSound, err = loadSound("jump_sound.ogg")
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }

       if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {

       game.jumpSound, err = loadAudio("jump_sound.ogg")
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }
       game.musicPlayer, err = loadAudio("background_music.ogg")
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }

       game.musicPlayer.Play()

       if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - **`loadAudio`** function handles loading both background music and sound effects.
   - **`main`** function plays background music and triggers sound effects based on game events.

**Exercise:** Implement multiple audio sources in your game. Test their interaction, and manage their playback to avoid excessive overlap and ensure a balanced audio experience.
